<h1> A world without gravity</h1>
<h2> Fatjon Mileti is a physics professor from the University of Albania, 
and his latest theory turns our understanding of gravity on its head.</h2> 
<h3>Gravity Unveiled</h3>
<p>Do you know what would happen if we could turn off gravity? With a little help from <b>Fatjon Mileti</b>, you'll soon find out.</p>
<h3>Rules of Gravity</h3>
<p>There are a few different rules that govern the laws of gravity,
 and it's important to get them all right. In this post, Professor Mileti unpacks some of the basics.</P>

<p>gravity, also called gravitation, in mechanics, the universal force of attraction acting between all matter.It is by far the weakest known
 force in nature and thus plays no role in determining the internal properties of everyday matter. On the other hand, through its long reach and universal
 action, it controls the trajectories of bodies in the solar system and elsewhere in the universe and the structures and evolution of stars, galaxies, and
 the whole cosmos.
 On Earth all bodies have a weight, or downward force of gravity, proportional to their mass, which Earth's mass exerts on them.
 Gravity is measured by the acceleration that it gives to freely falling objects.
 At Earth's surface the acceleration of gravity is about 9.8 metres (32 feet) per second per second. 
Thus, for every second an object is in free fall, its speed increases by about 9.8 metres per second.
 At the surface of the Moon the acceleration of a freely falling body is about 1.6 metres per second per second.
<h3>Early concepts</h3>
Newton argued that the movements of celestial bodies and the free fall of objects on Earth are determined by the same force.
 The classical Greek philosophers, on the other hand, did not consider the celestial bodies to be affected by gravity,
 because the bodies were observed to follow perpetually repeating nondescending trajectories in the sky. 
<h3>Weight and mass</h3>
<p>
Newton was thus able to show that all three of Kepler's observationally derived laws follow mathematically from the assumption
 of his own laws of motion and gravity. In all observations of the motion of a celestial body, only the product of G and the mass can be found.
